       "\"russian forces’ rate of advance in the bakhmut area has likely slowed in recent days, although it is too early to assess whether the russian offensive to capture bakhmut has culminated. russian milbloggers acknowledged that ukrainian forces in the bakhmut area have managed to slightly slow down the pace of the russian advance around bakhmut and its surrounding settlements, with one claiming that ukrainian forces pushed back elements of the wagner group to positions they held days ago. ukrainian social media sources previously claimed that ukrainian forces completely pushed russian forces out of the eastern outskirts of bakhmut around december 21. isw has also assessed that russian forces made slightly fewer overall advances in the bakhmut area in november and december combined as compared to the month of october. russian forces will likely struggle to maintain the pace of their offensive operations in the bakhmut area and may seek to initiate a tactical or operational pause. the united kingdom ministry of defense (uk mod) reported on december 24 that russian forces currently lack the necessary stockpile of artillery munitions to support large-scale offensive operations and that sustaining defensive operations along the lengthy frontline in ukraine requires the russian military to expend a significant number of shells and rockets daily. the ukrainian joint forces task force released an interview on december 24 with a ukrainian servicemember in the bakhmut area detailing that russian forces have been conducting an extremely high pace of assaults on ukrainian positions in the area with little corresponding progress. the wagner group’s reported heavy losses in the bakhmut area in recent weeks have also likely strained russian forces’ current operational capabilities in the area. the russian military’s personnel and munitions constraints will likely prevent it from maintaining the current high pace of offensive operations in the bakhmut area in the near-term. russian forces previously allocated significant resources in a meat-grinder effort to seize severodonesk and lysychansk in spring–summer 2022. russian forces culminated after capturing lysychansk in early july and failed to capture neighboring siversk to the east or slovyansk to the northeast. the russian military’s fixation with conducting a highly attritional campaign to achieve the tactical objectives of capturing severdonetsk and lysychansk ultimately undermined the russian military’s ability to achieve its larger operational objective to envelop ukrainian forces in a cauldron along the e40 highway and eventually drive to donetsk oblast’s western administrative borders. russia’s relentless and costly push on bakhmut may also degrade russia’s ability to pursue long-term objectives in the donbas theater. russian siloviki may be setting information conditions to justify the nationalization of oligarchs' resources to sponsor russia’s war effort. wagner financier yeveniy prigozhin attended the funeral of a deceased wagner group mercenary in st. petersburg on december 24, where he stated that russia needs to confiscate luxury possessions and accommodations from elites who ignore or do not support the war effort out of fear of losing their privileged lifestyles. prigozhin added that these affluent individuals support a vision where western curators dominate russia in return for the sponsorship of their lifestyles and compared today’s russian oligarchy to ukraine’s or to 1990s russia. prigozhin ignited a scandal regarding the burial of the wagner serviceman in recent weeks to push his political objectives — such as the legalization of wagner in russia — and his statements advocating redistribution of wealth at the funeral gained significant traction on the russian internet. wagner-affiliated milbloggers widely supported prigozhin’s criticism of russian officials and praised his support for the war effort. prigozhin may be using such populist proposals to elevate his authority in russian society or influence a return of stricter nationalization measures. russian president vladimir putin also indirectly attacked russian oligarchs on december 22, however, stating that russians who drain russia’s money from abroad and do not have a connection with the country represent a danger to russia. putin claimed that while the vast majority of russian businessmen are patriots, there are some who do not share the sentiment. putin concluded that everyone strives not only to stay, to live and work in russia but to work for the benefit of our country. putin previously nationalized big businesses in the early 2000s to consolidate his authoritarian kleptocracy and may be attempting leverage nationalization to coerce elites to support his war in ukraine or seize their property to fund military expenses. ukrainian intelligence continues to suggest that the russian military is not following proper command structures or procedures. chief of the ukrainian main military intelligence directorate (gur) kyrylo budanov stated that prigozhin formed an alliance with the commander of the russian armed forces in ukraine, army general sergey surovikin. budanov noted that both prigozhin and surovikin are rivals of russian defense minister sergey shoigu, and that prigozhin used the alliance to his advantage to receive heavy weapons from russian armed forces for wagner forces. the allocation of military resources should in principle rest with the minister of defense rather than the theater commander, although surovikin could have the authority to make transfers once equipment enters the theater. the prigozhin–surovikin alliance is plausible given that prigozhin had previously praised surovikin for his efforts to save the collapsing soviet union. ukrainian counteroffensives (ukrainian efforts to liberate russian-occupied territories) eastern ukraine: (eastern kharkiv oblast-western luhansk oblast) russian forces continued to conduct limited counterattacks to regain lost positions along the kreminna-svatove line on december 24. the ukrainian general staff reported that ukrainian forces repelled a russian assault near andriivka, luhansk oblast (15km west of svatove). a russian milblogger claimed that russian forces conducted assaults in the direction of stelmakhivka (16km northwest of svatove) and in the direction of nadiia (16km west of svatove). a russian milblogger claimed that russian forces have transitioned from offensive operations to positional battles near dvorichna (55km northwest of svatove). russian milbloggers claimed that russian forces conducted assaults in the direction of makiivka (23km northwest of kreminna) and in the area of chervonopopivka (6km north of kreminna) and that there are positional battles between russian and ukrainian forces in the vicinity of ploshchanka (17km northwest of kreminna). one russian milblogger claimed on december 23 that russian forces are now at a distance close enough to makiivka to effectively use small-arms fire against ukrainian forces. ukrainian sources reported that russian forces also conducted assaults in the direction of yampolivka, donetsk oblast (17km west of kreminna) and near bilohorivka (12km south of kreminna). a russian milblogger claimed that russian forces conducted an assault in the vicinity of dibrova (5km southwest of kreminna). ukrainian forces continued to strike russian rear areas on december 24. russian sources claimed that ukrainian forces struck polovynkyne, luhansk oblast (56km southeast of svatove) with himars rockets. social media sources posted footage indicating that ukrainian forces reportedly struck an unspecified warehouse in polovynkyne. russian main effort—eastern ukraine russian subordinate main effort—donetsk oblast (russian objective: capture the entirety of donetsk oblast, the claimed territory of russia’s proxies in donbas) russian forces continued to conduct offensive operations around bakhmut on december 24. the ukrainian general staff reported that ukrainian forces repelled russian assaults near bakhmut, within 19km northeast of bakhmut near rozdolivka and bakhmutske; and within 31km south of bakhmut near pivichne and niu york. a russian milblogger claimed that there is also fierce fighting northeast of bakhmut near pidhordone, where russian forces reportedly captured stronghold positions on the southern outskirts of the settlement. the russian milblogger claimed that russian forces also captured new positions in unspecified areas northeast of bakhmut along the rozdolivka-yampolivka line. a russian milblogger claimed that there is fierce fighting between ukrainian forces and elements of the wagner group in the eastern outskirts of bakhmut, where battles have been ongoing for days. russian milbloggers claimed that russian forces also conducted an assault south of bakhmut in the vicinity of andriivka and that there is fighting between russian and ukrainian forces within 17km south of bakhmut near opytne, klishchiivka, and dyliivka. russian forces continued to conduct offensive operations in the avdiivka–donetsk city area on december 24. the ukrainian general staff reported that ukrainian forces repelled russian assaults within 27km southwest of avdiivka near krasnohorivka, vodyane, and marinka. russian milbloggers claimed that russian forces are advancing farther into marinka, but that ukrainian forces are still entrenched in some positions in the center of the settlement. a russian milblogger claimed that ukrainian forces have been accumulating their forces on the western outskirts of marinka due to a rapid deterioration of the tactical situation in the settlement and extensive losses. the russian milblogger also claimed that the 11th regiment of the donetsk people’s republic (dnr) people’s militia conducted a reconnaissance-in-force operation in the direction of pervomaiske (13km southwest of avdiivka) and established a foothold in the outskirts of the settlement. the ukrainian general staff reported that russian forces continued indirect fire along the long of contact in donetsk and eastern zaporizhia oblasts. supporting effort—southern axis (russian objective: maintain frontline positions and secure rear areas against ukrainian strikes) russian forces did not conduct any confirmed ground attacks on the southern axis on december 24 but may be deploying equipment from donetsk to the southern axis. ukrainian advisor to the mayor of mariupol petro andryushchenko reported on december 24 that russian forces are transporting an unusually high number of armored personnel carriers and truck convoys through mariupol towards berdyansk in zaporizhia oblast to fortify the melitopol front. russian forces struck a residential area of kherson city with a grad multiple launch rocket system (mlrs) on december 24, killing at least 10 and injuring 55. most if not all the victims were civilians. several russian sources falsely claimed that ukrainian forces conducted the strike as part of a false flag to blame russian forces for reasons that remain unclear. one russian source falsely claimed that this attack was a repeated ukrainian false flag attack modeled after the russian tochka u strike that killed 60 ukrainian civilians at the train station in kramatorsk, donetsk oblast, on april 8 — a russian strike that the russian government falsely accused ukraine of conducting. a few russian milbloggers mocked the lie that ukrainian forces conducted the mlrs attack against kherson city. independent monitors have thoroughly documented russia’s deliberate and regular strikes against civilian targets in ukraine. russian spetsnaz are likely reconnoitering the dnipro river delta to study ukrainian defenses in right-bank kherson oblast. a russian source reported on december 23 unspecified russian spetsnaz elements landed on velykyi potomkin island southwest of kherson city at an unspecified recent time. this report is consistent with ukrainian officials’ statements. the head of the ukrainian joint press center of the tavrisk direction defense forces, yevhen yerin, stated on december 23 that russian forces have not changed their tactics in southern ukraine and are continuing to use sabotage and reconnaissance groups to reconnoiter the islands on the dnipro river delta in kherson oblast to test the ukrainian ability to repel russian attacks. a russian source claimed that russian forces defeated ukrainian attempts to land on the kinburn spit. the source reported that ukrainian forces regularly shell the spit with long-range artillery and destroyed an unspecified port building on the spit. the source reported that russian forces defeated unspecified ukrainian attempts to land on the spit, that ukrainian forces are constantly trying to gain a foothold on the spit, and that that russian forces fully control the spit despite several attempted ukrainian attacks there. kherson oblast occupation administration head vladimir saldo similarly claimed on december 22 that russian forces are repelling ukrainian attempts to land on the spit. ukraine’s southern operational command spokesperson natalia humenyuk stated on november 22 that ukrainian forces are conducting operations on the kinburn spit under operational silence. ukrainian forces likely conducted a drone attack against targets in crimea on december 24. video posted in the early morning of december 24 reportedly shows an explosion from a ukrainian drone attacking an oil refinery in nyzhniohirskyi raion in crimea. a prominent kremlin-linked milblogger reported that ukrainian forces launched seven chinese-made mugin-5 drones from the odesa international airport to hit targets in crimea in the early morning of december 24. this account claims that russian air defenses shot down all seven drones: five drones over the karkinit bay and two over crimea as the drones approached targets near the oil refinery in nyzhniohirskyi raion and the tavricheska thermal power plant near simferopol. it is unclear if russian forces shot down the drone near the oil refinery as the milblogger reported given the ambiguous video of an explosion. mobilization and force generation efforts (russian objective: expand combat power without conducting general mobilization) the russian orthodox church — a kremlin-controlled institution — asked the kremlin for a mobilization exemption for its clergy, despite avidly supporting russian president vladimir putin’s war in ukraine. head of the russian orthodox church patriarch kirill stated that he heard numerous concerns from clergy about the church being subject to mobilization during the diocesan meeting in moscow on december 22. kirill noted that currently russian law does not exempt clergy from military service, which contradicts the holy canons against the church participating in combat. kirill added that the church received an exemption during the period of partial mobilization but called on the kremlin to formally secure this provision in law for clergy. kirill, however, publicly stated that he shares putin’s opinions on very important issues and called on russians to spiritually mobilize so that russia and ukraine can reunite into the one sphere of the russian orthodox church. russian priests have also repeatedly blessed russian military personnel and equipment before combat and while dressed in military uniforms prior to putin’s mobilization order. kirill’s request further highlights that mobilization is not popular among even kremlin-affiliated institutions despite ongoing support for the war effort. the kremlin authorized the russian ministry of defense (mod) and ministry of information to request up-to-date information about citizens via a centralized registry on december 23, likely to facilitate military registration and mobilization processes in russia. the russian mod may access passport data, permanent residence registration documentations, and information on the number of children to create conscription or mobilization lists. in november, putin ordered the kremlin to create a centralized database for military registration by april 2024 and called on the russian mod to start digitizing print documents currently stored in local military recruitment centers throughout russia. ukrainian intelligence previously reported that the kremlin seeks to create an electronic database by february 2023, possibly in preparation to support a second wave of mobilization. ukrainian military officials reported that russian casualties are continuing to overload the medical system in occupied ukraine. deputy defense minister hanna malyar reported that many russian personnel die waiting for medical assistance due to lack of specialists, necessary medical equipment, and medicine. malyar added that russian forces are also installing metal bars on the windows of hospitals to prevent russian servicemen with light wounds from deserting from the russian armed forces. the russian mod had previously claimed that 92% of deaths among russian forces occur as a result of lack of first aid medical attention; however, isw cannot independently verify this assessment. russian milbloggers continued to disagree with select parts of the russian mod’s proposed plan on december 22 to form new military formations. a prominent milblogger and a member of putin’s mobilization working group stated that the russian mod should not form five naval infantry divisions and two new airborne assault divisions as shoigu suggested but should instead create line heavy infantry and motorized rifle divisions. the milblogger argued that russian naval infantry and airborne troops do not have the necessary artillery power to be effective in the war in ukraine. activity in russian-occupied areas (russian objective: consolidate administrative control of and annexed areas; forcibly integrate ukrainian civilians into russian sociocultural, economic, military, and governance systems) russian officials are planning to take children from horlivka, donetsk to belarus, potentially as a scheme to deport ukrainian children. zaporizhia occupation deputy vladimir rogov announced on december 24 that belarusian citizens organized a trip for children from horlivka, donetsk oblast to go to belarus. he stated that the children are already on their way. isw is unable to verify if these children are expected to return to occupied donetsk oblast after this event. the deportation of children may amount to a violation of the convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide and constitute a wider ethnic-cleansing effort, as isw has previously reported. russian occupation authorities are continuing to intensify law enforcement crackdowns in occupied territories. a russian media source claimed that the russian ministry of internal affairs detained eight people in kherson oblast on december 24 under suspicion of aiding ukrainian forces. the ukrainian general staff reported that russian occupation officials in hornostaivka, kherson oblast have imposed a 24-hour curfew for residents from december 25 to january 3, likely in an effort to keep ukrainian residents from leaving occupied territories during the holidays. russian occupation officials continue efforts to nationalize ukrainian property in occupied territories. the ukrainian resistance center reported on december 24 that russian occupation officials continue to threaten ukrainians in occupied territories with nationalization of their property. the report stated that occupation officials are forcing residents to re-register their property claims under russian law and threatening to take the property should residents fail to do so. the ukrainian resistance center noted that russian occupiers have already created a platform for selling nationalized property and the belongings of those who fled their homes in occupied territories. the luhansk military administration also reported that russian occupation authorities in luhansk oblast publicized the names of homes and apartments they have designated for flexible housing stock — nationalization and occupation by russian forces — and are requiring residents to appear within 10 calendar days of the publicization to consent to or refuse the designation of flexible house on their property. the report stated that, should the resident not appear, the russian occupation officials will automatically house people there for three years. russian occupiers continue to make life difficult for ukrainians in occupied territories. the luhansk military administration reported that ukrainians in luhansk oblast have increased their complaints about ever-rising prices for essential items. the luhansk military administration also reported that russian occupation authorities have begun signaling that no one will rebuild destroyed housing in luhansk oblast, despite previous promises to the contrary. isw will continue to report daily observed indicators consistent with the current assessed most dangerous course of action (mdcoa): a renewed invasion of northern ukraine possibly aimed at kyiv. isw’s december 15 mdcoa warning forecast about a potential russian offensive against northern ukraine in winter 2023 remains a worst-case scenario within the forecast cone. isw currently assesses the risk of a russian invasion of ukraine from belarus as low, but possible, and the risk of belarusian direct involvement as very low.\""

       "'ukrainian forces have inflicted a major operational defeat on russia, recapturing almost all kharkiv oblast in a rapid counter-offensive. the ukrainian success resulted from skillful campaign design and execution that included efforts to maximize the impact of western weapons systems such as himars. kyiv’s long discussion and then an announcement of a counter-offensive operation aimed at kherson oblast drew substantial russian troops away from the sectors on which ukrainian forces have conducted decisive attacks in the past several days. ukraine’s armed forces employed himars and other western systems to attack russian ground lines of communication (glocs) in kharkiv and kherson oblasts, setting conditions for the success of this operation. ukrainian leaders discussed the strikes in the south much more ostentatiously, however, successfully confusing the russians about their intentions in kharkiv oblast. western weapons systems were necessary but not sufficient to secure success for ukraine. the ukrainian employment of those systems in a well-designed and well-executed campaign has generated the remarkable success of the counter-offensive operations in kharkiv oblast. the ukrainian recapture of izyum ended the prospect that russia could accomplish its stated objectives in donetsk oblast. after retreating from kyiv in early april, the stated russian objectives had been to seize the complete territory of luhansk and donetsk oblasts. the russian campaign to achieve these objectives was an attack along an arc from izyum through severodonetsk to the area near donetsk city. that attack aimed to seize severodonetsk, lysychansk, slovyansk, bakhmut, and kramatorsk, and continue to the western boundary of donetsk oblast. russian forces managed to take severodonetsk on june 24 and lysychansk on july 3 after a long and extremely costly campaign but then largely culminated, seizing no major settlements and little territory. the russian position around izyum still threatened ukrainian defenders of slovyansk, however, and retained for the russians the opportunity to return to the attack on the northern sectors of the arc, which they had largely abandoned by the middle of july in favor of a focus on siversk (near lysychansk) and bakhmut. the loss of izyum dooms the initial russian campaign plan for this phase of the war and ensures that russian advances toward bakhmut or around donetsk city cannot be decisive (if they occur at all). even the russian seizure of bakhmut, which is unlikely to occur considering russian forces have impaled themselves on tiny surrounding settlements for weeks, would no longer support any larger effort to accomplish the original objectives of this phase of the campaign since it would not be supported by an advance from izyum in the north. the continued russian offensive operations against bakhmut and around donetsk city have thus lost any real operational significance for moscow and merely waste some of the extremely limited effective combat power russia retains. there is no basis for assessing that the counter-offensive announced in kherson oblast is merely a feint, however. ukrainian forces have reportedly attacked and made gains at several important locations on the western bank of the dnipro river. they have cut the two bridges across the river and continue to keep them cut as well as interfere with russian efforts to maintain supply via barge and pontoon ferry. ukraine has committed considerable combat power and focused a significant portion of the western-supplied long-range precision systems it has to this axis, and it is not likely to have done so merely to draw russian forces to the area. the ukrainian pressure in kherson combined with the rapid counter-offensive in kharkiv presents the russians with a terrible dilemma of time and space. russia likely lacks sufficient reserve forces to complete the formation of a new defensive line along the oskil river, as it is reportedly trying to do before ukrainian forces continue their advance through that position if they so choose. prudence would demand that russia pull forces from other sectors of the battlespace to establish defensive lines further east than the oskil river to ensure that it can hold the luhansk oblast border or a line as close to that border as possible. but russian troops around bakhmut and near donetsk city continue offensive operations as if unaware of the danger to luhansk, and russian forces in kherson still face attack and the threat of more attacks on that axis. russian president vladimir putin risks making a common but deadly mistake by waiting too long to order reinforcements to the luhansk line, thereby compromising the defense of kherson or ending offensive operations around bakhmut and donetsk city without getting troops into position to defend against continuing ukrainian attacks in luhansk in time. the ukrainian campaign appears intended to present putin with precisely such a dilemma and to benefit from almost any decision he makes. the current counter-offensive will not end the war. the campaign in northeast ukraine will eventually culminate, allowing the russians to re-establish a tenable defensive line and possibly even conduct localized counterattacks. ukraine will have to launch subsequent counter-offensive operations, likely several, to finish the liberation of russian-occupied territory. the war remains likely to stretch into 2023. ukraine has turned the tide of this war in its favor. kyiv will likely increasingly dictate the location and nature of the major fighting, and russia will find itself increasingly responding inadequately to growing ukrainian physical and psychological pressure in successive military campaigns unless moscow finds some way to regain the initiative. russian officials and milbloggers involved with the russian war in ukraine are increasingly blaming the russian ministry of defense (mod) for russian failures on the frontlines. chechen leader ramzan kadyrov stated that if there are no changes to the russian special military operation today or tomorrow, then he will contact the kremlin to explain the situation on the ground. kadyrov’s statement is a thinly veiled criticism of the russian mod for its lack of situational awareness (or honesty) and highlights the mod’s preoccupation with maintaining the façade of a successful and swift russian invasion of ukraine. the russian mod has not acknowledged the successful ukrainian counteroffensive operations around kharkiv oblast, instead promulgating a clearly false narrative of a deliberate russian repositioning without any meaningful justification. a milblogger also noted that a civilian such as the head of the wagner group private military company yevgeniy prigozhin should replace russian defense minister sergey shoigu because civilians can better handle the harmful nature of the military bureaucracy. the intensifying public attacks on shoigu and the russian mod shield russian president vladimir putin from the responsibility for setting unattainable goals for the invasion and likely micromanaging military operations by pinning all the blame for russian failures on the mod and higher military command. putin may accept and even support these attacks to continue this diversion of blame from him. the kharkiv oblast counter-offensive is already damaging the kremlin’s relationship with the russian mod, further alienating putin from the higher military command. kremlin spokesperson dmitry peskov stated that putin has postponed all his meetings with the leadership of the russian mod and representatives of the russian defense industry in sochi—a bizarre decision in the face of the military operational and defense industrial crisis facing russia. the russian defeat in the battle of kharkiv oblast will only intensify public criticism of shoigu and the mod, which may lead to personnel changes. the ukrainian main military intelligence directorate (gur) reported that the western grouping of forces has been placed under the command of the commander of the central military district colonel general alexander lapin who is currently commanding the central group of forces in ukraine. the gur added that the kremlin is looking for a replacement for the commander of the western grouping of forces lieutenant general roman berdnikov, who had just replaced lieutenant general andrey sychevoy on august 26. ukrainian authorities shut down the last active reactor at the zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (znpp) on september 11. ukrainian nuclear energy agency energoatom announced that it began to prepare nuclear reactor no. 6 for a cold shutdown after energoatom restored a backup powerline connecting the znpp to the ukrainian power grid on september 11. energoatom stated that the reactor had been producing energy at 10-15% of its capability, the bare minimum necessary to sustain znpp operations. energoatom stated that a cold shutdown is the safest state for the znpp as frequent russian shelling continues to damage power lines necessary to operate the plant safely. the russian ministry of defense (mod) claimed that ukrainian forces shell the znpp as part of a broader campaign against energy infrastructure in occupied territories and russian milbloggers amplified this narrative. energoatom and the international atomic energy agency reiterated that shelling the znpp must end and that russian authorities must demilitarize and declare a safe zone around the znpp. russian forces conducted a wave of precision strikes against ukrainian energy infrastructure on september 11 causing widespread power outages. the attacks are likely meant to let moscow claim that it is launching a new phase of offensive operations even as it loses on the ground, and possibly also to punish ukraine for shutting down the znpp despite russia’s desire to keep it operating. ukrainian counteroffensives (ukrainian efforts to liberate russian-occupied territories) eastern ukraine: (vovchansk-kupyansk-izyum-lyman line) the russian ministry of defense’s september 11 briefing map confirmed that russian forces are withdrawing from settlements around kharkiv city, from northern kharkiv oblast, and settlements on the western bank of the oskil river. russian sources and milbloggers have identified the oskil river that flows through kupyansk and izyum as the new front line on the axis, and russian forces are likely also continuing to operate on the eastern bank of the siverskyi donets river southeast of izyum. geolocated and social media footage confirmed that ukrainian forces have entered vovchansk and velykyi burluk severing russian ground lines of communication (glocs) along the t2104 highway and have reached the international border north of kharkiv city. geolocated footage also shows that ukrainian forces took control of izyum and settlements south and southwest on september 11. russian troops likely withdrew from the area in great haste, and social media posts show abandoned tanks and other heavy military equipment near izyum, which indicates that russian troops failed to organize a coherent retreat. russian sources claimed that ukrainian troops are continuing efforts to cross the siverskyi donets river northeast of slovyansk and enter lyman. a russian milblogger indicated that russian troops are targeting ukrainians around lyman, but that russian troops retain control of the settlement despite attempted ukrainian advances. combat footage taken in bilohorivka, luhansk oblast, on september 11 confirms that ukrainian troops have retaken ground in luhansk oblast. the ukrainian soldiers in the footage appear to be hiding from artillery strikes, which indicates that russian troops are now targeting positions in bilohorivka. southern ukraine: (kherson oblast) granular tactical and operational-level visibility on the progress of the ukrainian counteroffensive in kherson oblast has been degraded over the last few days as the focus of coverage has shifted to the ukrainian counteroffensive in kharkiv oblast. this shift in the information space is not likely reflective of a pause in ukrainian operations in the south, and ukrainian troops are likely to continue counter-offensive operations in kherson oblast based on the limited reporting that is available. ukrainian military officials stated that ukrainian forces continued positional battles and strikes on russian transportation, logistics, and military assets throughout the southern axis on september 11. ukraine’s southern operational command reiterated that ukrainian troops are engaged in positional battles in unspecified areas along the kherson-mykolaiv frontline and carried out over 130 fire missions over the day. the ukrainian general staff stated that ukrainian troops have carried out over 28 major strikes and hit approximately 19 concentrations of russian manpower and military equipment within the last 24 hours. ukrainian military officials indicated that ukrainian troops focused on hitting russian bridges and alternative river crossings to disrupt russian transportation capabilities across the dnipro river. footage taken by residents of kherson oblast on september 10 and 11 corroborates statements made by ukrainian officials regarding the continued ukrainian interdiction campaign along the southern axis. social media users reported explosions near kakhovka and nova kakhovka (about 60km east of kherson city), which substantiates statements made by ukrainian military officials that ukrainian troops hit an ammunition depot and ferry crossing in this area on the night of september 10. residents of kherson city additionally posted images of smoke in the wake of a ukrainian strike on a russian headquarters within kherson city on september 10. ukrainian forces also continued to target russian rear areas south of the dnipro river and reportedly struck russian positions in razdolne, about 15km southeast of nova kakhkovka. neither russian nor ukrainian sources discussed specific kinetic activity along the kherson-mykolaiv frontline on september 11. a russian milblogger stated in vague terms that ukrainian forces are engaged in positional battles in unspecified locations. despite the lack of concrete descriptions of fighting in specific areas, however, ukrainian troops likely are continuing to threaten russian control of terrain along the frontline. the ukrainian general staff stated that russian troops struck ukrainian positions in bruskynske, about 75km northeast of kherson city along the critical t2207 highway that runs into nova kakhovka. this strike may indicate that ukrainian forces are pushing east of the nearby sukhyi stavok pocket and continuing efforts to interdict russian ground lines of communication in western kherson oblast. the russian ministry of defense (mod) continued to highlight excessive and likely overblown estimates of ukrainian losses in kherson oblast on september 11 and did not make any additional claims on the status of the counter-offensive. russian sources are increasingly focused on providing commentary on ukrainian advances in kharkiv oblast. russian main effort- eastern ukraine russian subordinate main effort- donetsk oblast (russian objective: capture the entirety of donetsk oblast, the claimed territory of russia’s proxies in donbas) russian forces continued ground attacks in donetsk oblast on september 11. the ukrainian general staff reported that ukrainian forces repelled russian ground assaults in various settlements near bakhmut and avdiivka. the continued allocation of russian forces to relatively small and insignificant settlements in donetsk oblast will likely harm russian forces’ ability to reinforce positions to defend against the ongoing ukrainian counteroffensive in kharkiv oblast. continued offensive operations in the bakhmut and avdiivka area cannot offset russian losses in southern ukraine and kharkiv oblast or achieve significant enough gains to justify continuing them. russian military leadership is seemingly unable to adapt to this reality as it continues to impale troops in attacks on tiny villages near bakhmut and avdiivka. russian sources also claimed that ukrainian forces began reinforcing and demining the vuhledar area in western donetsk oblast. russian forces continued routine shelling along the line of contact in donetsk oblast. supporting effort #1- kharkiv city (russian objective: prevent ukrainian forces from reaching the russian border) note: the successful ukrainian counter-offensive in kharkiv oblast has rendered this section unnecessary. it will not appear in future updates. supporting effort- southern axis (russian objective: maintain frontline positions and secure rear areas against ukrainian strikes) russian forces conducted air, artillery, and missile strikes along the line of contact in southern ukraine on september 11. russian forces targeted dnipro city, dnipropetrovsk oblast, mykolaiv city, and voznessensk, mykolaiv oblast with cruise missiles and airstrikes. russian forces fired on nikopol and marhanets, dnipropetrovsk oblast with multiple launch rocket systems, likely from positions near enerhodar on the opposite bank of the kakhovka reservoir. mobilization and force generation efforts (russian objective: expand combat power without conducting general mobilization) russian authorities are continuing to pull combat power from various external sources to support operations in ukraine. the ukrainian general staff reported that occupation authorities are planning to prevent men from leaving occupied territories to forcibly mobilize them. chechen republic head ramzan kadyrov announced on september 12 that the chechen republic has finalized the formation of a regiment and three new battalions totaling 3,180 combat-ready personnel. kadyrov stated that 580 personnel compose each battalion, and 1,500 personnel compose the regiment. these units likely refer to chechen rosgvardia sever regiment, and the vostok, zapad and yug akhmat battalions deployed to ukraine. russian authorities are likely struggling to pay military volunteers their promised salaries. rostov oblast outlet rostov tsargrad reported that russian bars-4 volunteers who served in ukraine and returned to russia are facing issues receiving their salaries and health benefits. one bars-4 volunteer reported receiving disparate treatment for his battlefield injuries and claimed that russian authorities deleted all records of him ever suffering an injury in ukraine and that other bars volunteers face similar issues. activity in russian-occupied areas (russian objective: consolidate administrative control of occupied areas; set conditions for potential annexation into the russian federation or some other future political arrangement of moscow’s choosing) the success of the ukrainian counteroffensives is likely impacting the will and ability of russian authorities to conduct annexation referenda. latvia-based russian-language outlet meduza reported that the kremlin decided to indefinitely postpone annexation referenda of all occupied ukrainian territories as of september 11. meduza cited sources close to the kremlin that claimed that the kremlin only decided to postpone annexation referenda due to the counteroffensive and that the kremlin pulled its political technologists who had been organizing the referenda in kharkiv and zaporizhia oblasts back to russia. ukrainian mayor of melitopol ivan fedorov stated that fewer than 10% of melitopol residents (where the current total population is roughly 50% of the pre-war population) are willing to vote in an annexation referendum and that continued partisan movements and ukrainian military victories are driving russian authorities to postpone the referenda. occupation authorities may be fleeing from occupied ukraine to russia as ukrainian forces advance towards russian rear areas. mariupol mayoral adviser petro andryushenko stated that donetsk people’s republic (dnr) head denis pushilin and dnr mayor of mariupol konstantin ivashchenko were supposed to attend a military parade in mariupol on september 11 but did not and that their current whereabouts are unknown. ukrainian luhansk oblast head serhiy haidai stated that occupation authorities are fleeing from occupied territories, including those that russian proxy authorities have held since 2014. ukrainian mayor of enerhodar dmytro orlov posted a screenshot of a telegram post made by an unspecified occupation authority that called on civilian collaborators to leave occupied territories for russia.'"
